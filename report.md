# SkilStak Pro Final Report - Winter 2016


*My project to was to create a game called doge dodge in Swift were you had to aviod falling doges. DogeDodge was orginally created at skilstak in the game class and I decided to make a version in Swift (a programming language for ios apps) using SpriteKit (a frame work for creating ios games).*

## Lessons Learned

*If I had to do anything differrent next  time I would spend more time researching SpriteKit. The main lesson that I learned is that swift code for different frameworks can be hugley different.*

## Next Steps

*I would like to probally create a better way to move the dodger with the accelorometer with this project.*
